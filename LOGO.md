# Logo Prompts for Bansho

**Project Context**: An MCP security gateway that sits between MCP clients and servers, providing API-key authentication, role-based authorization, rate limiting, and audit logging — all without requiring upstream code changes.

**Suggested Vibe**: Technical, trustworthy, modern infrastructure — serious enough for enterprise security, distinctive enough to stand out in the developer tools space.

## Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Primary | Deep Emerald | `#0D5C4D` | Evokes stability, security, and the "guardian" nature of a gateway. Green signals safety and trust while being distinct from typical blue security products. |
| Secondary | Warm Terracotta | `#C75B39` | Unexpected warmth for a security product — adds personality and memorability. Represents the human element in security operations. |
| Accent | Electric Cyan | `#00D4E5` | Modern, technical, AI infrastructure feel. High contrast against the deep emerald for visibility and energy. |
| Neutral | Slate Graphite | `#2C3E50` | Professional, serious foundation. Works well for text and supporting elements without the coldness of pure black. |

**Why This Palette Works**:
- Breaks the "blue security product" convention
- Emerald green = security + growth (protecting while enabling)
- Terracotta adds unexpected warmth and memorability
- Cyan accent brings modern AI/tech energy
- Together: trustworthy yet distinctive

## Design Rationale

Bansho is a security gateway for MCP (Model Context Protocol) infrastructure. The name evokes protection and monitoring (Japanese "bansho" = guard post).

Key visual themes:
- **Gateway/portal**: Represents the proxy nature — traffic passes through
- **Shield/protection**: Security layer protecting upstream servers
- **Key**: API key authentication is central to the system
- **Eye/sentinel**: Audit logging and monitoring capabilities
- **Hexagon**: Modern tech aesthetic, suggests structural stability

## Usage Notes

**Primary application**: Use Deep Emerald as the dominant color for brand consistency.

**Accent usage**: Electric Cyan works best for:
- Call-to-action elements
- Interactive states
- Security status indicators (active/secured)

**Secondary warmth**: Terracotta adds approachability for:
- Marketing materials
- Community-facing content
- Error/warning states (when paired with darker tones)

**Avoid**: Do not use all four colors simultaneously in the logo mark. Maximum two colors per logo variation for clarity and reproducibility.
